This repository hosts datasets pertaining to two distinct domains: fruits and trains. The primary objective of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to delve into the characteristics, trends, and potential insights embedded within these datasets.

Fruits Dataset
The fruits.csv dataset encompasses various attributes associated with different types of fruits. Each entry in the dataset includes information regarding the weight, color, size, taste rating, and price of the fruit. The dataset aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the attributes and variations present among different fruits.

Train Dataset
Contrarily, the train_data.csv dataset captures diverse facets of train-related information. It contains details such as the speed, passenger capacity, route, departure, and arrival times of different trains. This dataset facilitates an exploration of the operational aspects and characteristics of various trains.
